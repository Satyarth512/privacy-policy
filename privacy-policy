# Privacy Policy for FocusFlow

**Last Updated:** January 18, 2026

FocusFlow ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our application uses your data and the high-level permissions we request.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

**FocusFlow does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal user data to external servers.** All processing happens locally on your device.

## 2. Accessibility Service Permission

FocusFlow requires the Android **Accessibility Service permission** to function. This permission is used **strictly** for the following purpose:

*   **App Blocking:** To detect when a distraction app (selected by you) is opened and to display a blocking overlay over it during active focus sessions.

**We do NOT use the Accessibility Service to:**
*   Read your screen content (emails, messages, passwords).
*   Change your device settings without your permission.
*   Track your interaction with other apps for advertising or analytics.

The service is active only when you have enabled the "App Blocking" feature within FocusFlow.

## 3. Camera Permission

FocusFlow requests access to your device's **Camera**. This permission is used exclusively for:

*   **Photo Missions:** To verify that you have completed specific tasks (e.g., taking a photo of a specific object) to dismiss an alarm.

**Camera Usage Details:**
*   Photos are processed **locally** on your device using on-device Machine Learning (TensorFlow Lite).
*   Photos are **NOT** uploaded to any server, cloud storage, or third-party service.
*   Photos are **NOT** stored permanently on your device gallery unless explicitly saved by you. They are discarded immediately after the verification process.

## 4. Usage Data & Analytics

We do not track or analyze your app usage history externally. All session data (Pomodoro timers, tasks) is stored locally using SQLite / Shared Preferences on your device.

## 5. Contact Us
