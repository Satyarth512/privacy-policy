# Privacy Policy for FocusFlow

**Last Updated:** January 18, 2026

FocusFlow ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our application uses your data and the permissions we request.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

**FocusFlow does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal user data to external servers.** All processing happens locally on your device.

## 2. Accessibility Service Permission

FocusFlow requires the Android **Accessibility Service permission** to function. This permission is used strictly for the following purpose:

*   **App Blocking:** To detect when a distraction app (selected by you) is opened and to display a blocking overlay over it.

**We do NOT use the Accessibility Service to:**
*   Read your screen content (emails, messages, passwords).
*   Change your device settings without your permission.
*   Track your interaction with other apps for advertising or analytics.

The service is active only when you have enabled the "App Blocking" feature within FocusFlow.

## 3. Usage Data

We do not track or analyze your app usage history. The app checks the package name of the currently active application solely to determine if it matches a blocked app in your list. This check is performed locally in real-time and is not recorded.

## 4. Third-Party Services

Review the privacy policies of any third-party services you may interact with through our app, though FocusFlow itself does not integrate third-party analytics or ad networks.
